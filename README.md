:mortar_board: My name is Juan Franco, and I'm currently a student at the University of South Florida, pursuing a BS of Science in Computer Science.

:briefcase: I currently work at the USF IT department as a level I Service Desk Student Assistant. This challenging job requires excellent communication and time management skills to provide a high standard of quality level to the department, as well as a high technical understanding to be able to provide quick and efficient IT-related solutions to the clients. 

:computer: I am passionate about what I do and spend a lot of time <b>learning new things</b> that are applicable to real-life challenges and solutions. I worked on a website project using Django (python), SQL, HTML, and CSS, whose purpose is to notify you through :e-mail: email when a seat becomes available to register for your class at USF.

:roller_coaster: As a hobby outside of Technology (although sometimes related), I love theme parks. I like to meet with my friends every other weekend and have some fun together at :european_castle: Walt Disney World, :leopard: Busch Gardens Tampa, or :earth_americas: Universal Orlando Resort.

:airplane: I love traveling around the world and discovering new cultures. I find very interesting places that are outside of what I'm culturally used to, and use them to learn many new things applicable to my professional life.
